A file transfer GUI apps for windows

Satroka is an Electron JS based app that allow its users to transfer file between their PC.
For the time being, it only works for Windows because it uses Everything CLI to maximize search speed.
So, before you start, I recommend installing Everything on your computer.
Thus, You need to run the first Everything scan of your directory tree, and once it is finished :
- Run `npm i`
- After every dependencies are installed, run `npm start`
- That's it.

NOTE : As this is the first commit, the app itself contains so much bugs ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ I will fix all of them along the way.
